Middle Ages Era v0.71
Created by KingJohnVI

The idea behind this era was to combine a few great ideas I saw in other eras with a few of my own to create a more of an "empire creation" feeling to the game.  In this vein I wanted to create a basic middle ages style era, have factions representing real parts of the world, and most importantly, allow players to expand using their officers to capture territory rather than using themselves.  It's nice to go to war and lead from the front, but it's better if you can watch at a safe distance. 
  
So far, I am focusing on balance, both within the faction and on the map.  Please feel free to comment on the game balance, but keep in mind that it is still very early in development.  I may eventually include ships as well.

Also, I have included many images from the core Wesnoth directory and from other eras including the Imperial Era, Medieval Combat, Era of Magic, Era of Myths, Archaic Era, and I was inspired by many of the concepts found in the 18th Century Era.

Finally, thanks to everyone who has helped me with bugs, code, and testing; your help is greatly appreciated!
